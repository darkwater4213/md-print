## Persuasive Speech  

When one asks the question of whether a certain piece is good or even great art one generally gives a simple yes or no. But when one is then asked to give an explanation as to why it is great art, one generally has to turn from pure aesthetics and emotion to tenets that are slightly more objective, even if only partially so. As Christians, we recognize that these tenets are the Classical triumvirate of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. <!--Some may contest the relative objectivity of Beauty. But while beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it is still a well-articulated concept, unlike aesthetics or raw reactionary emotions, and is therefore better communicated, if still imperfectly so.-->Truth in that the piece agrees with God, Goodness in that it is aligns wih God's Word, and finally Beauty in that it reflects God's heart. One philosopher put it more concisely, although not Biblically: "Beauty pleases the eye, Goodness pleases the heart, and Truth pleases the mind." Dale Chihuly's _Pink and White Seaform Set #1_, is a prime example of all three: It affirms what God has said about us and the world, it aligns with God's Word, and it reflects the heart of God.  

Truth is a neat concept. If something is true about the world, then it is true no matter who you are, where you are from, or where you are going. Truth is black-and-white: there is no half-true. There are things of which half is true, and the other half is not, but it is not true that these are half-true. Because truth is of this nature, we can prove things exist -- without ever having to find them.  We can decide whether or not something is true and be right without ever having to actually test it. Things can be right -- because of Truth. Truth not only makes our lives easier, it makes them _rational_.  

Chihuly's _Seaform Sets_ are not designed to be a representation of any single aquatic lifeform. Rather, they are made to be evocative of marine life. They would not look out of place in an aquarium, but appear as more of an amalgam of a variety of marine life, rather than any one specific being.

Goodness is an entirely different matter. Saying some thing is good because it is true is much like saying a lightning bug is dangerous because it has the word "lightning" in it. While being true certainly is part of it, it is not the whole of it. What _is_, is what God says. When He made the world, He called it Good. And so it was. God had decreed that all He had created was Good -- there is no changing that. We humans, in our foolishness and naïveté, conciously chose to abandon the eternal Goodness God laid before us and trade it for the immediate, merely temporary pleasures that are all this world can offer.  

It was not just us humans that fell -- all of God's creation fell with us. We live in a broken world -- there is no denying that.  

But. God.  

But God. Pronounced us Very Good.  
But God. Called His whole creation Very Good -- even in its broken state.  
But God. Came down in the flesh to redeem us from our brokenness.  
But God. Didn't just make us Very Good - He made us holy. Along with His entire creation.  
  
> ### Romans 8:1-2  
>  
> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free...  

And such is the heart of God, that men are to be free and Himself to be glorified. Indeed there is no better glorification than to revere His handiwork; His creation.  

There are few sculptures of any sort as beautiful as these. And while beauty is almost entirely subjective, it is very hard to deny that the organic, free-flowing nature of the _Seaforms_ are beautiful. There is just something so pleasing about the blend of glass, delicate colors and even more delicate shapes, that is impossible to think of as anything but beautiful. Beauty, like emotion, is hard to put to exact words; in fact, it is well nigh impossible for one to do so and communicate what one is trying to say in a meaningful, concise fashion. But the beauty of these is so plainly evident that words need hardly be said.  

So, if we can demonstrate, as has been done, that this work affirms Truth, Goodness, and Beauty in that it agrees with God and His word and reflects His heart, then we can say that this work is certainly a great work of art.

[1] Can you say something about how _Seaforms_ are a depiction of God's creation, which is beautiful?

## Truth  

God calls us to be creative, to create. If we as human beings were not creative, then what a brutal world we would live in! No art, no music, no poetry or literature, save possibly for histories, and, worst of all, no math. Perhaps it might be efficient, but what good is being efficient if there is no good thing to spend time saved from efficiency on? It would not be just the world that would have no soul -- we would have no souls.  

## Goodness  

It is most certainly good. God created the oceans and all that lives in them and He called it good.  

## Beauty  

There is no denying that it is beautiful. It may not be recognizable of any specific aquatic lifeform, but I is certainly evocative of many. The colors blend together seamlessly, creating a soft contrast between the pink and the white, producing a soothing `...`
